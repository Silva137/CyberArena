Which of the following is a common vector used by threat actors to gain unauthorized access?;Internal company memos.;Phishing sites and messages.;Authorized user credentials.;Regular software updates.;B;Threat actors often use phishing, through sites or messages, as a vector to gain unauthorized access. This can involve targeting individuals through non-business communication channels to extract information.
What role do security policies play in incident response within an organization?;They are only used for reporting incidents to external authorities.;They have no role in incident response as this is purely a technical process.;They provide financial support for losses incurred during security incidents.;They outline the procedures and responsibilities for responding to security incidents.;D;Security policies play a critical role in incident response as they outline the standard procedures, roles, and responsibilities for effectively responding to and managing security incidents. These policies ensure a coordinated and prompt response to mitigate the impact of incidents.
Which technology is crucial for protecting corporate data on mobile devices if they are lost or stolen?;Unrestricted app installations.;Open Bluetooth connectivity.;Disabling screen locks.;Remote wipe capabilities.;D;Remote wipe capabilities allow organizations to remotely erase data on a lost or stolen device, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.
What is the primary purpose of using a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) in a cloud environment?;To replace the need for a firewall.;To decrease network performance.;To manage and enforce security policies across multiple cloud services.;To store all user credentials in a central location.;C;CASBs are security policy enforcement points that ensure compliance and security policy consistency across multiple cloud services used by an organization.
Why is 'Security Misconfiguration' a significant vulnerability?;It can slow down system performance due to improper settings.;It often causes system downtime and unavailability.;It results in increased costs for security maintenance.;It can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.;D;Security Misconfiguration can occur at any level of an application stack and can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches if security settings are not properly configured or are default, outdated, or incomplete.
What is a key aspect to consider for securing an application in the cloud?;The physical location of the cloud servers.;The security of the code, container, and cluster of the application.;The speed of the application's performance in the cloud.;The color scheme and user interface design of the application.;B;When securing an application running in the cloud, it's important to consider the security of the code, container, and cluster, as part of the 4C's of Cloud Native Security.
When implementing identity and account management controls, which of the following is the most effective method to ensure user accountability?;Assigning group accounts for all users.;Using shared passwords for convenience.;Disabling audit logs to simplify management.;Implementing unique user accounts for each individual.;D;Unique user accounts ensure that activities can be traced back to individual users, enhancing accountability and security.
What type of digital forensic analysis focuses on recovering deleted, encrypted, or damaged file information?;Live Forensics;Data Recovery;Malware Analysis;Network Forensics;B;Data recovery is a key aspect of digital forensics that involves retrieving deleted, encrypted, or damaged information from digital devices.
Why are specialized systems considered challenging in terms of security?;They always operate independently of other systems.;They are less important than general-purpose systems and thus receive less focus on security.;Their specialized nature can require unique security approaches.;They only use outdated software and hardware.;C;Specialized systems can pose security challenges because their specialized nature may require unique and specific security approaches that differ from those used in general-purpose systems.
What is the primary purpose of the NIST Framework in organizational security?;To outline procedures for handling personal health information.;To provide a set of industry standards and best practices to help organizations manage cybersecurity risk.;To monitor and control internet traffic in the United States.;To enforce legal compliance with specific security measures in financial organizations.;B;The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework assists organizations in better understanding, managing, and reducing cybersecurity risks, thereby strengthening their security posture. It offers guidelines and best practices rather than enforcing legal compliance.
Which of the following is a critical aspect of secure application deployment?;Prioritizing aesthetic aspects of the application.;Focusing solely on the cost-efficiency of the deployment tools.;Implementing secure protocols and secure network architecture concepts.;Ensuring rapid deployment regardless of security checks.;C;A critical aspect of secure application deployment is the implementation of secure protocols and secure network architecture concepts. This ensures that the application is robust against various cyber threats.
Which data source is most effective for identifying unauthorized changes to system files and configurations during an incident?;Employee time tracking software;Physical access control logs;Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts;File integrity monitoring systems;D;File integrity monitoring systems are specifically designed to detect changes in files and configurations. They are effective in identifying unauthorized alterations that could indicate a cybersecurity incident.
When designing a network for a large organization with different departments, what is a key consideration for enhancing security?;Avoiding the use of wireless networks entirely.;Ensuring all devices use the same operating system for uniformity.;Utilizing a single shared network for all departments.;Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) on the network.;D;RBAC ensures that individuals only have access to the network resources necessary for their roles, enhancing overall security.
For a company looking to maintain operations during a major incident, such as a data center failure, which of the following would be the most appropriate solution?;Implementing RAID storage systems;Establishing hot, cold, and warm sites;Deploying an advanced firewall system;Segmenting the internal network;B;Hot, cold, and warm sites are disaster recovery solutions that allow businesses to quickly recover and maintain operations in the event of significant incidents like data center failures.
