Unauthorized devices are connecting to your company's Wi-Fi, causing congestion. What is the BEST solution to prevent unauthorized access?;Disable Wi-Fi;Implement MAC address filtering;Reduce Wi-Fi range;Change the Wi-Fi password weekly;B; MAC address filtering allows you to specify which devices can connect based on their unique hardware addresses, preventing unauthorized devices from joining the network.; Easy; Network Security.
While conducting a security audit, you discover that many devices on the company network are still using outdated software prone to vulnerabilities. What action should you take FIRST?;Create a software upgrade policy;Isolate all outdated devices;Inform the users to manually update their software;Develop a security awareness program;A; Establishing a policy ensures that all devices receive updates automatically and regularly, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited.; Easy; Network Security.
You're prompted by users that their legitimate emails are being classified as spam. What is the FIRST step you should take?;Install anti-spam software;Contact the email service provider;Check the spam filter settings;Whitelist affected email addresses;C; Checking the spam filter settings allows you to adjust the sensitivity and ensure legitimate emails are not improperly flagged as spam, resolving the issue directly.; Easy; Network Security.
During a penetration test, the tester successfully gains access to internal systems by guessing a weak password. What is the most effective immediate action to enhance password security?;Implement CAPTCHA on login pages;Increment password complexity requirements;Introduce password expiration policies;Provide user training on strong passwords;B; Increasing password complexity requirements provides an immediate technical measure that enhances password strength, reducing the likelihood of password guessing attacks.; Medium; Network Security.
You are responding to a security incident where data packets are being captured and potentially altered. Which technology would MOST effectively address this issue?;Deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF);Implementing a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN);Using Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);Adopting encryption protocols like HTTPS;D; Encryption protocols ensure data integrity and confidentiality in transit, preventing packet capture and modification.; Medium; Network Security.
A user reports their PC is running sluggishly and exhibiting out-of-the-ordinary behavior, indicative of malware. What should be your FIRST step in investigation?;Run a full antivirus scan;Reboot the computer;Disconnect the computer from the network;Check system performance logs;C; Disconnecting the computer mitigates the risk of malware spreading across the network and allows for a safe investigation environment.; Medium; Network Security.
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is overwhelming your organization's server. What is the BEST immediate mitigation strategy to handle this?;Increase server bandwidth;Implement rate limiting;Change server IP address;Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN);B; Implementing rate limiting helps mitigate immediate server overload by controlling the amount of incoming traffic that can affect the server at any given time.; Hard; Network Security.
A famous vulnerability has been announced that affects your web server's software version. Until a patch is released, what is the BEST temporary mitigation strategy you should implement?;Turn off the server temporarily;Restrict access to server ports;Apply virtual patches via WAF;Upgrade the hardware of the server;C; Virtual patches mitigate risks associated with vulnerabilities by monitoring and blocking attack vectors, buying time until an official patch is available.; Hard; Network Security.
Your organization logs indicate a potential internal data breach however, the suspect device's logs are inconsistent with the others. What is the MOST effective technique to determine the breach source?;Analyze logs using automated tools;Manually review suspicious log entries;Employ network anomaly detection systems;Change all user access credentials;C; Anomaly detection systems can efficiently identify unusual patterns that indicate the source of an internal data breach, providing key insights.; Hard; Network Security.
An organization notices a sudden drop in network performance. Upon investigation, large volumes of unsolicited ICMP packets are being sent to the network.;Botnet DDoS attack;Spoofed SYN flood attack;ICMP Flood attack;DNS Amplification attack;C; An ICMP Flood attack overwhelms a network with ICMP packets, degrading performance. Botnet DDoS, SYN flood, and DNS Amplification are types of DDoS but use different techniques.;Easy;Network Security.
You've been asked to identify anomalous login attempts in a network. You find multiple entries of failed logins with sequential usernames.;Brute force attack;Man-in-the-Middle attack;DNS Spoofing;Phishing attack;A; Sequential usernames in failed logins suggest a brute force attempt, where attackers try many username-password combinations to gain unauthorized access.;Easy;Network Security.
During routine monitoring, you notice an unauthenticated user attempting to intercept communications between client and server.;ARP Spoofing;SSL Stripping;DNS Cache Poisoning;IP Spoofing;A; ARP Spoofing involves redirecting network traffic, which can lead to interception. SSL Stripping and DNS Cache Poisoning involve different manipulation methods, while IP Spoofing disguises a source IP.;Easy;Network Security.
A company implements a new firewall, and legitimate traffic is being blocked unexpectedly. What might you need to check first?;Advanced persistent threat detection rules;Misconfigured access control lists;DDoS attack prevention settings;Intrusion detection system logs;B; Misconfigured Access Control Lists can accidentally block legitimate traffic due to improper rule setups. Other options involve different network security issues.;Medium;Network Security.
The network team observes scattered instances of high network latency in certain segments. They suspect due to a MAC Flooding attack. How can they mitigate this issue?;Implement MAC filtering;Configure spanning tree protocol;Use port security;Disable unused ports;C; Port security can limit the number of MAC addresses per port, reducing risk from a MAC Flood, which causes a switch to act like a hub, leading to latency.;Medium;Network Security.
While conducting a network security assessment, you identify that several devices are using weak encryption protocols. What would be an immediate section of your remediation plan?;Implement stronger passwords;Upgrade devices to use TLS 1.2 or higher;Deploy multi-factor authentication;Segment the network;B; Upgrading devices to a robust protocol like TLS 1.2 enhances encryption strength, addressing the weak encryption directly. Stronger passwords and multi-factor do not address protocol weakness.;Medium;Network Security.
Your IDS has detected repeated large data exfiltration attempts from a single internal IP address at non-business hours.;Disable all internet access for the host;Enhance firewall ruleset;Initiate a forensic investigation;Apply rate limiting on the IP;C; A forensic investigation is crucial to understand if it's a deliberate data exfiltration, ensuring correct measures are applied. Other responses do not address the root cause and future protections.;Hard;Network Security.
A critical business application experiences unexpected downtime after a recent patch was applied. The host system does not respond to external network requests.;Roll back the recent patch;Increase server resources;Inspect DNS configurations;Check NTP settings;A; Rolling back the patch can restore functionality if the patch caused downtime. DNS and NTP are less likely causes of immediate application-specific downtime.;Hard;Network Security.
A network admin discovers encrypted packets leaving the internal network to a foreign IP address cyclically.;Disable outgoing traffic to the IP;Upgrade encryption standards;Inspect for a possible data breach;Limit bandwidth for that IP;C; The behavior suggests potential data exfiltration or a breach, and requires investigation. Merely blocking or limiting traffic does not resolve a possible breach.;Hard;Network Security.
