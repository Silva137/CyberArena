A company wants to enhance its user authentication process for accessing sensitive data by adding an extra layer of security. Which of the following is the best approach to achieve this?; Use complex passwords; Implement IP whitelisting; Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA); Enforce periodic password changes; C; Multi-Factor Authentication provides an extra layer of security by requiring more than one method of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, even if passwords are compromised.; Easy;IAM
In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), what is the primary purpose of assigning roles to users?; To provide a personalized interface; To minimize administrative overhead; To enforce session timeouts; To restrict access to a single user only; B; RBAC minimizes administrative overhead by defining user privileges based on their role within an organization, facilitating easier management and scaling of permissions.; Easy;IAM
Which authentication protocol is commonly used for single sign-on (SSO) solutions, allowing users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications?; SSH; TLS; SAML; SNMP; C; Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is widely used for single sign-on solutions, allowing secure exchanges of authentication and authorization data between the identity provider and service providers.; Easy;IAM
An organization needs to implement an authorization framework that allows its applications to access user data from other applications without revealing the user's credentials. Which protocol should they use?; Kerberos; OAuth; RADIUS; PAP; B; OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used to grant websites or applications limited access to user information without exposing passwords.; Medium;IAM
What key advantage does OpenID Connect provide over OAuth 2.0 in terms of authentication?; More security policies; It is simpler to implement; It includes an identity layer and ID tokens; It supports more programming languages; C; OpenID Connect, an identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0, introduces ID tokens which enable verifying the user's identity in addition to obtaining user authorization.; Medium;IAM
An enterprise network admin decides to use Privileged Access Management (PAM) systems. What is the main benefit of including PAM in their security strategy?; Increase operational costs; Simplify network topology; Enhance control over high-risk accounts; Ensure remote access for all users; C; Privileged Access Management systems provide enhanced control over high-risk accounts by monitoring, managing, and securing privileged access across the enterprise.; Medium;IAM
During a security review, a company realizes that APIs intended for public use are exposing too much data. Which IAM strategy will most effectively mitigate this issue?; Limit API requests based on IP address; Implement RBAC; Enforce strict rate limiting; Use API gateways with OAuth scopes; D; API gateways with OAuth scopes allow organizations to control what data and operations are exposed through APIs by assigning specific scopes to each application, thereby ensuring precise access control.; Hard;IAM
A software development team is tasked with ensuring their mobile application uses secure authentication flows. What is a primary security concern when implementing OAuth 2.0 on mobile devices?; Backend server appears offline; Device battery consumption increases; Access tokens stored insecurely.; Reduced application performance; C; On mobile devices, it's crucial to securely store access tokens since they provide ongoing access to the server. Insecurity can result in token leakage and potential exploitation.; Hard;IAM
During integration between different applications, a security architect notes the need for identity verification without direct access to user credentials. Which standard allows this kind of verification process?; HTTP Digest Authentication; LDAP; JSON Web Tokens (JWT); Challenge-Response; C; JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties, commonly used for authenticating requests and session handling.; Hard;IAM
What is the primary benefit of implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in an organization?;Reduces the need for regular audits;Limits excessive user access;Increases individual accountability;Speeds up login procedures;B;RBAC helps prevent over-provisioning of permissions by assigning users to roles based on their job responsibilities, thereby limiting access to only the information and resources necessary.;Easy;IAM
