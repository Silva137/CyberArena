A company uses a centralized SIEM for log collection from Linux servers using syslog-ng. The security team notices intermittent but significant delays in log arrival from several key servers during peak hours. Initial checks show no packet loss between servers and the SIEM. What is the most likely bottleneck causing the delay?;Insufficient disk space on the SIEM collector.;Syslog-ng flow-control settings being triggered due to processing limitations.;Network bandwidth saturation between server sites.;Incorrect timestamp synchronization (NTP) between servers and SIEM.;B;Syslog-ng has flow-control mechanisms (log_fifo_size, flow-control) that can throttle message sending if the destination (SIEM) or intermediate relays can't process logs fast enough, causing delays even without network packet loss.;Hard;Operating Systems Security

A Linux file server stores sensitive project data. The requirement is that new files and directories created within project shares must automatically inherit the group ownership of the parent directory and allow group members full access, while restricting others. What is the most effective combination of standard Linux features to achieve this?;Use chmod -R 770 periodically.;Set the setgid bit on the project directories and configure an appropriate umask for users.;Implement Filesystem ACLs (Access Control Lists) on the project directories.;Configure NFS export options with rw,sync,no_root_squash.;B;Setting the setgid bit on a directory ensures new files/dirs inherit its group ownership. A user umask (e.g., 002 or 007) ensures new files/dirs get appropriate default permissions (like rw-rw-r-- or rwxrwx---), correctly implementing the requirement using standard features.;Hard;Operating Systems Security
