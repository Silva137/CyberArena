A pen tester is analyzing the security of a web application. During the assessment, the tester retrieves the robots.txt file and notices several Disallow directives. Understanding that web spiders, robots, or crawlers can intentionally ignore these directives, which of the following is the most accurate conclusion the tester can draw from this information?;The Disallow directives can be used to effectively protect sensitive web application directories from being indexed by search engines and accessed by unauthorized users.;The Disallow directives in the robots.txt file are suggestions for the behavior of web spiders, robots, or crawlers and are not enforced by the server, making them unreliable for security enforcement.;The robots.txt file is a legal document that web spiders, robots, or crawlers must adhere to, and any violation of the Disallow directives can lead to legal consequences for the offending party.;The presence of Disallow directives indicates a robust security configuration, ensuring that the specified paths are completely inaccessible to all web spiders, robots, or crawlers.;B;WebSecurity
If an adversary has wiped configuration files on network devices using Network Device CLI commands, why would upgrading network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) alone not be sufficient to prevent such incidents in the future?;Because NIDS are primarily focused on monitoring network traffic and may not detect command execution or unauthorized changes to device configurations.;Because NIDS are outdated technology and have been replaced by next-generation firewalls in modern network security infrastructures.;Because NIDS typically prevent physical access to network devices, not the execution of CLI commands by authorized users.;Because NIDS are designed to prevent data backups from being accessed or destroyed, which is not relevant to wiping configuration files.;A;NetworkSecurity, PenTest
A web application has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance security. Which of the following actions would be considered a best practice in the context of robust MFA implementation?;Using a single factor for sensitive accounts to simplify the login process.;Implementing MFA only for user accounts but not for administrative accounts.;Employing MFA for all relevant accounts and ensuring protection against brute-force attacks.;Avoiding auditing and logging of MFA-related activities to maintain user privacy.;C;WebSecurity, ApplicationSecurity
Review the following JavaScript code snippet used in a web application. Identify the line that introduces a potential security vulnerability due to improper use of encoding or decoding:;"var encodedData = btoa(userInput);";"var decodedData = atob(encodedData);";"var urlEncodedData = encodeURIComponent(userInput);";"var htmlEncodedData = escape(userInput);";D;WebSecurity, ApplicationSecurity
In a security audit, you discover that an adversary has been leveraging the `dlopen` and `dlsym` functions in Linux to execute shared objects from arbitrary paths. Which of the following scenarios is a possible cause for this security issue?;The system's antivirus software is outdated, allowing adversaries to exploit known vulnerabilities.;The application control settings are not configured to restrict module loading to trusted directories.;Network firewall settings are improperly configured, allowing external access to internal resources.;The intrusion detection system is not set up to monitor module load activities effectively.;B;SystemSecurity, ApplicationSecurity, PenTest
In the context of cryptographic systems, what is the primary purpose of utilizing a 'unique ID (UID)' within a device's security infrastructure? (Select all that apply.);To act as a one-off number in various security protocols, ensuring the uniqueness of each transaction or session.;To serve as a 256-bit AES key that is used by the processor's hardware AES Engine, which is critical for data encryption processes.;To identify web-based resources uniquely and consistently across different platforms and services.;To generate a secure and unique signature for provisioning profiles, which enables apps to be installed and tested on iOS devices.;B;SystemSecurity
